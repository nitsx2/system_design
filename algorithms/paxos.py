Simple Paxos Algorithm Implementation with Comprehensive Documentation
====================================================================

This script implements the Paxos consensus algorithm with detailed explanations
of how it works, why each step is necessary, and real-world applications.

PAXOS ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
========================
Paxos solves the consensus problem in distributed systems: How can multiple 
nodes agree on a single value even when some nodes may fail or messages may be lost?

KEY PROPERTIES:
- SAFETY: Only one value can ever be chosen (consistency guarantee)
- LIVENESS: Eventually a value will be chosen (progress guarantee) 
- FAULT TOLERANCE: Works as long as majority of acceptors are available

REAL-WORLD USAGE:
- Google Spanner (global distributed database)
- Apache Cassandra (distributed NoSQL database)
- Google Chubby (distributed lock service)
- Apache ZooKeeper (coordination service)
- etcd (distributed key-value store)

ALGORITHM PHASES:
===============
Phase 1 (Prepare/Promise):
- Proposer asks acceptors: "Can I propose with number N?"
- Acceptors respond: "Yes, and here's any value I previously accepted"
- Purpose: Reserve the right to propose and learn about constraints

Phase 2 (Accept/Accepted):  
- Proposer says: "Please accept this value with number N"
- Acceptors respond: "OK, I accept it" (if it doesn't violate promises)
- Purpose: Actually vote on and commit to the proposed value

SAFETY MECHANISM:
================
The key insight is that acceptors make promises in Phase 1. Once an acceptor 
promises not to accept lower-numbered proposals, it never violates that promise.
This prevents conflicting values from being chosen simultaneously.

PAXOS CONSTRAINT:
================
If any acceptor returns a previously accepted value in Phase 1, the proposer 
MUST use the value from the highest-numbered previous proposal. This ensures 
that once a value starts being accepted, all future proposals use that value.

üèõÔ∏è  PAXOS CONSENSUS ALGORITHM - COMPREHENSIVE DEMONSTRATION
===========================================================

WHAT IS PAXOS?
- Fundamental distributed consensus protocol (Leslie Lamport, 1990)
- Solves the problem: "How can distributed nodes agree on a value?"
- Used in production by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, etc.

KEY GUARANTEES:
‚úÖ SAFETY: Only one value can ever be chosen (no split-brain)
‚úÖ LIVENESS: Eventually a value will be chosen (progress guarantee)  
‚úÖ FAULT TOLERANCE: Works with up to (N-1)/2 failures in N-node system

ALGORITHM PHASES:
üîÑ Phase 1 (Prepare/Promise): Reserve right to propose, learn constraints
üó≥Ô∏è  Phase 2 (Accept/Accepted): Vote on proposed value, achieve consensus

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Database leader election (MongoDB, MySQL Cluster)
- Configuration management (Kubernetes, etcd)
- Distributed locking (Chubby, ZooKeeper)  
- Transaction coordination (Spanner, CockroachDB)
